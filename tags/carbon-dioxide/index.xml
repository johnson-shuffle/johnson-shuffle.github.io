      <description>A major component of my dissertation centered on the relationship between carbon emissions and environmental voting in congress. To understand this relationship better I wanted to link emissions from a legislatorâ€™s constituency to their voting patterns. For senators, this step was straightforward as the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) provides state-level inventories of CO\(_2\) emissions. For representatives, this requires district-level inventories which the EIA does not provide directly. However, it is possible to construct such inventories (at least from the electricity sector) using information the EIA does provide: plant-level fuel consumption used for electricity generation, spatial locations of individual plants, and carbon dioxide emissions factors for commonly used fuels.</description>
