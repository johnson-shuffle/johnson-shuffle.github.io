      <description>Below is a look into racial bias in Seattle’s Terry stop data which I did as part of volunteer work for Data For Democracy. The analysis is based on a paper which examines “Stop-and-Frisk” in New York City which can be found here.
 Data  Seattle Incident-Based Reporting Below are maps which show the spatial locations of all Seattle Police Department (SPD) incidents in 2016 for which data is available.</description>

      <description>A major component of my dissertation centered on the relationship between carbon emissions and environmental voting in congress. To understand this relationship better I wanted to link emissions from a legislator’s constituency to their voting patterns. For senators, this step was straightforward as the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) provides state-level inventories of CO\(_2\) emissions. For representatives, this requires district-level inventories which the EIA does not provide directly. However, it is possible to construct such inventories (at least from the electricity sector) using information the EIA does provide: plant-level fuel consumption used for electricity generation, spatial locations of individual plants, and carbon dioxide emissions factors for commonly used fuels.</description>

      <description>I finally decided to bite the bullet and create a blog to document my exploration of economics and data science. This decision was made in tandem with an effort to start incorporating Git into my workflow. Why Git? I became more interested after reading this paper which I found via Revolution Analytics’ blog. Incidentally, the author of that paper has an awesome introduction to Git and GitHub which can be found here.</description>
