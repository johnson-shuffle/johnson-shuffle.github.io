# Biography

I'm Jake. I recently completed my PhD in economics at UCSD choosing to focus on the political economy of environmental voting in the United States Congress as well as the theoretical aspects of international environmental agreements.  Along the way I developed an interest in data science more generally and its intersection with R.  I grew up and currently reside in Seattle, WA.
